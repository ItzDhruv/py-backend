Good morning. How are you feeling today?
Not good, doctor. I feel very sick.
Can you tell me your symptoms?
Yes, I have a fever, sore throat, and my body aches.
Let's check your temperature first. Please open your mouth.
Okay, doctor.
You have a high fever. Now I need to look at your throat. Say ah.
Ah.
Read positive books.
Your throat is red. We need to do a small test to find out more. It's quick and easy.
Okay, doctor, what should I do?
Just a little swab from your throat. It won't hurt.
All right, I'm ready.
Good job. We'll have the results soon. For now, rest is important. Drink lots of water and keep taking the fever medicine.
Thank you, doctor. Will I be okay?
Yes, with the right treatment, you'll start to feel better. We'll take good care of you.
Thank you so much, doctor.
You're welcome. We're here to help. If you need anything, just let us know.
I'll bring you some water and more fever medicine.
Thank you, nurse. When will we know the test results?
The results should be ready by tomorrow. The doctor will talk to you as soon as we have them.
Do I need to stay in the hospital?
Yes, we want to make sure you are okay. You need to rest here tonight.
Okay, I understand. I hope it's nothing serious.
The doctor and team are very good. They will take good care of you. Try not to worry.
I'll try. Thank you for helping me.
Of course. It's our job to help. If you need anything during the night, just call.
I will. Thank you again.
My eyes are itchy and I keep sneezing.
How long has this been going on?
About a week now.
It sounds like allergies. Have you been around anything new? Pets? Plants?
Oh, I visited a friend who has a cat.
You might be allergic to cats. Try to avoid them and I'll give you some allergy medicine.
Will that stop the itching and sneezing?
Yes, it should help.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome. Take care.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon, doctor. My back hurts a lot.
Where exactly does it hurt?
Lower back.
Did you lift something heavy?
Yes, I did yesterday.
It sounds like you strained your back. Rest and apply heat.
For how long?
A few days. Avoid heavy lifting. If it doesn't get better, we might need to do more tests.
All right, thank you.
No problem. Be careful and get well soon.
